# Data-analysis-Using-Excel
This project involves analyzing the raw data, e.g., sales data, customer feedback, financial data, etc. using Microsoft Excel. The objective was to uncover insights and find trends that could inform business decisions, strategies, predictions, etc. The analysis includes the following key components:

Data Cleaning: Raw data was cleaned and preprocessed, handling missing values and inconsistencies.
Data Transformation: Data was manipulated using Excel functions like VLOOKUP, IF statements, and text functions for better analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) and visualization techniques were applied using Excel's built-in tools (e.g., charts, pivot tables).
Pivot Tables & Charts: Summarized data using pivot tables for in-depth insights, and visualized trends using bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.
Statistical Analysis: Applied basic statistical methods (e.g., regression analysis, correlation) to analyze relationships within the data.
